PythonTeX provides fast, user-friendly access to Python from within LaTeX.  It allows Python code entered within a LaTeX document to be executed, and the results to be included within the original document.  It also provides syntax highlighting for code within LaTeX documents via the Pygments package.

See pythontex.pdf for installation instructions.  See pythontex_gallery.pdf for examples of what is possible with PythonTeX.
